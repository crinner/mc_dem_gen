# mc_dem_gen
Minecraft DEM Generator

Script for importing digital elevation model (DEM) into Minecraft/McEdit
June 2015 by Claus Rinner

See description at http://gis.blog.ryerson.ca/2015/06/08/toronto-elevation-model-in-minecraft/

Code is partially based on jsa's "mountain_gen.py" - generating hilly & mountainous terrain in MCEdit.
Uses ASCII GRID import according to http://geospatialpython.com/2013/12/python-and-elevation-data-ascii-grid.html

As of version 0.1, the iteration through rows and columns of the DEM data file seems mixed up, resulting in a wrongly oriented world. Should be an easy fix.
